### transaction

- `/v1.0/transaction/send`         (POST) --> receives a single transaction in JSON format and forwards it to an observer in the same shard as the sender's shard ID. Returns the transaction's hash if successful or the interceptor error otherwise.

- `/v1.0/transaction/send-multiple` (POST) --> receives a bulk of transactions in JSON format and will forward them to observers in the rights shards. Will return the number of transactions which were accepted by the interceptor and forwarded on the p2p topic.
- `/v1.0/transaction/send-user-funds` (POST) --> receives a request containing `address`, `numOfTxs` and `value` and will select a random account from the PEM file in the same shard as the address received. Will return the transaction's hash if successful or the interceptor error otherwise.

- `/v1.0/transaction/:txHash/status?sender=senderAddress` (GET) --> returns the status of the transaction which corresponds to the hash (faster because will ask for transaction status from the observer which is in the shard in which the address is part).

### vm-values

- `/v1.0/vm-values/hex`            (POST) --> receives a VM Request (`scAddress` string, `funcName` string and `args` []string) and returns the result of the VM Query in hex encoded string format

### node

Please note that `altered-accounts` endpoints will only work if the backing observers of the Proxy have support for historical balances (`--operation-mode historical-balances` when starting the node)

### blocks

- `/v1.0/blocks/by-round/:round`    (GET) --> returns all blocks by round

### block-atlas

- `/v1.0/hyperblock/by-nonce/:nonce?withAlteredAccounts=true`  (GET) --> returns a hyperblock by nonce, with transactions and altered accounts in each notarized block. Other available query parameters are `&tokens=token1,token2` as described in the `block` section above

- `/v1.0/hyperblock/by-hash/:hash?withAlteredAccounts=true`  (GET) --> returns a hyperblock by hash, with transactions and altered accounts in each notarized block. Other available query parameters are `&tokens=token1,token2` as described in the `block` section above

# V_next

This serves as a placeholder for further versions in order to provide a real use-case example of how performing
CRUD operations over endpoints works.
What is different from `v1_0`:
- `/v_next/address/:address/shard` is updated and returns a hardcoded `37` as shard ID
- `/v_next/address/:address/new-endpoint` is added a returns a hardcoded `"test"` as data field
- `/v_next/address/:address/nonce` is removed

The rest of endpoints remain the same.

## Faucet
The faucet feature can be activated and users calling an endpoint will be able to perform requests that send a given amount of tokens to a specified address.

In order to use it, first set the `FaucetValue` from `config.toml` to a value higher than `0`. This will activate the feature. Then, provide a `walletKey.pem` file near `config.toml` file. This will make the `/transaction/send-user-funds` endpoint available.
